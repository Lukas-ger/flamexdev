### Welcome ðŸ‘‹
I'm a german student and I love programming stuff as you can see ðŸ˜œ

> At the moment I'm looking for a job for the upcoming summer holidays in germany.

I have experience in React, JavaScript (Node.js), a bit of C#, HTML and CSS. In my freetime I'm developing websites like [discord-botlist.eu](https://discord-botlist.eu) also called `dbleu` with some others.
I am programming for about a year now and I try to become better.
